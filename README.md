This respository contains the work I've done during my Virtual Data Science work experience with British Airways. 
The first task involved scraping customer reviews and conducting sentiment analysis to present findings in a powerpoint presentation.
During the second task, I prepared data and trained the Random Forest Machine learning model to predict customer buying behaviour.
